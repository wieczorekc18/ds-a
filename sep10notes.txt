I’m the candidate you’ve been looking for to fill this position. I’m a software engineer with a focus on web development. My skills include JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, React.js, Redux.js, HTML5, and CSS. I recently graduated from the #1 ranked coding bootcamp, App Academy, where I had the opportunity to substantially refine my skills. If given the opportunity I could hit the ground running in order to deliver on the services you provide to clients. I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks,
Corey
